║           DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL NODES                ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
1. Masternode registration now uses the announced listen address 
   (e.g., 50.28.104.50:24100) instead of ephemeral connection ports
   (e.g., 50.28.104.50:57730)

2. Added automatic block sync - nodes check peers every 30 seconds
   and download missing blocks automatically

3. Added hostname to logs so you can identify which node is reporting

4. Fixed the add_block() method so nodes can properly receive and
   store blocks from peers


DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR EACH NODE:
================================

1. STOP THE DAEMON:
   Press Ctrl+C to stop the running daemon

2. CLEAR THE DATABASE (removes duplicate registrations):
   
   Linux/Mac:
   $ rm -rf ~/.timecoin/testnet
   
   Windows:
   > Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $env:APPDATA\timecoin\testnet

3. PULL THE NEW CODE:
   $ cd /path/to/timecoin
   $ git pull origin main

4. BUILD THE NEW BINARY:
   $ cargo build --release

5. RESTART THE DAEMON:
   $ ./target/release/timed --network testnet

6. VERIFY:
   - Check logs show: 🖥️  Hostname: <your-hostname>
   - Watch for: ✅ <count> masternodes registered, creating genesis block
   - Should see 3+ nodes once all are updated


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER UPDATE:
================================
- Nodes will see each other's registrations properly
- Count will increase to 3+ masternodes
- Genesis block will be created automatically
- Nodes will sync blocks from each other every 30 seconds
- Logs will show which hostname each message comes from


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If genesis still doesn't trigger after all nodes updated:
1. Check all nodes show the SAME hostname format in logs
2. Verify all nodes are on the SAME network (testnet)
3. Check firewall allows port 24100 (P2P)
4. Look for 'Registered masternode:' messages with :24100 ports
   (NOT ephemeral ports like :57730)
